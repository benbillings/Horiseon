# Horiseon

## Deployed Application
https://benbillings.github.io/Horiseon/

### Purpose

Horiseon started as a webpage that looked okay from the surface, but the code had many issues. I hoped to fix these issues which included 
links that didn't work properly, unorganized css, and imcomplete elements like the title. I took the original site and organized the html 
to become more semantically structured; I also condensed the css without changing any of the already complete styling, and I fixed all 
other issues to create a finished product that will make making future changes much simpler.

A side goal of mine was to become familiar with git and GitHub while working on this project.

### Challenges

Being my first time truly working with git and GitHub, I struggled at first with the process of adding, commiting, and pushing my work 
after each coding session. After completing this project however, I feel much more confident in my abilities moving forward.
